# Random Graph Generation Visualizer

This is the code for my undergrad final assignment.

The idea is to take what I've learned with
[this project](https://github.com/bamorim/graph_generator_vis) and improve upon it.

This project aims to have a way to share model scripts (probably using lua) and a better interface
for starting simulations.
